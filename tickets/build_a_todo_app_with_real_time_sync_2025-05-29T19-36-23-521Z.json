Without these specifications, the implementation could fail to meet unstated requirements or need significant rework. Real-time sync particularly needs clear specifications around conflict resolution and latency expectations."

    "reasoning": "A todo app with real-time sync has several distinct responsibilities that warrant decomposition: 1) UI layer for task display and interaction, 2) State management for local todo data, 3) Real-time sync service to handle server communication and websockets, 4) Data persistence layer for offline functionality. These components have clear interfaces and boundaries - UI components emit events and receive state updates, sync service handles network operations independently, and the data layer manages persistence. Decomposition will enable: parallel development by different team members, isolated testing of each component, easier debugging of sync issues, and the ability to modify one component without affecting others. The real-time nature adds enough complexity to make decomposition valuable but the overall scope remains manageable with clear separation of concerns."

The interfaces are well-defined with async operations for backend communication, and the dependency flow is unidirectional (UI → Store → Sync) which is ideal.\nGaps: Error handling interfaces not explicitly defined, No offline capability/conflict resolution specified, Authentication/user management not included, No loading states or status indicators defined in UI\nIssues: SyncService might need reconnection/retry logic, TodoStore doesn't specify how it maintains local state, No explicit interface for batch operations, UI component lacks input validation interfaces"
