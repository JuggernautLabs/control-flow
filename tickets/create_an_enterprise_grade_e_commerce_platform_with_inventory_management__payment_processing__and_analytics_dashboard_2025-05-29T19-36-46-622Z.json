    "value": true,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "This project should be decomposed into components because: 1) It has clearly distinct functional domains (inventory, payments, analytics) that can operate independently, 2) Each component has well-defined responsibilities and natural interface boundaries (e.g., payment processing API, inventory status queries), 3) Decomposition will enable parallel development by different teams and isolated testing of each component, 4) Components can be scaled independently based on load (e.g., analytics vs checkout), 5) Different components may have different security requirements (payment processing vs dashboard), 6) Components can be maintained and updated separately without affecting the entire system, 7) The enterprise-grade requirement suggests need for maintainability and scalability that component architecture provides"

OrderManagement provides necessary orchestration between components.\nGaps: User authentication and authorization system, Shopping cart management service, Customer profile management, Notification system for order updates, Data backup and recovery mechanisms, Logging and monitoring infrastructure\nIssues: No explicit error handling in interfaces, Analytics dashboard might need real-time data streaming capability, Missing rate limiting and security considerations in interfaces, No explicit versioning strategy for APIs, Payment processor might need more detailed security interfaces"
