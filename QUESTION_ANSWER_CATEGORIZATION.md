# Question/Answer Source Categories for Ticket Decomposition Engine

Based on the ticket structure and decomposition engine analysis, here are the distinct categories of questions and answer sources that emerge from the recursive task decomposition system.

## Question/Answer Source Categories

Each field in the ticket structure demands different types of observation and requires different kinds of answers:

### 1. **Definition Questions** (`terms`)
- **Source**: Domain expertise, existing documentation, standards
- **Nature**: Clarifying meaning, establishing shared vocabulary
- **Interface**: Human expert → AI → structured definition
- **Example**: "What does 'user-friendly' mean in this context?"

### 2. **Refinement Questions** (`termsNeedingRefinement`) 
- **Source**: Technical specification, architecture decisions
- **Nature**: Decomposing vague terms into concrete specifications
- **Interface**: AI analysis → human technical input → refined specification
- **Example**: "What are the specific technical requirements for 'scalable'?"

### 3. **Stakeholder Questions** (`openQuestions`)
- **Source**: Business requirements, user needs, constraints
- **Nature**: Requirements gathering, scope clarification  
- **Interface**: Human stakeholder → business analyst → requirements
- **Example**: "What is the expected user load?" "What's the budget constraint?"

### 4. **System Questions** (`engineQuestions`)
- **Source**: AI preferences, technical curiosity, approach validation
- **Nature**: Meta-questions about the decomposition process itself
- **Interface**: AI → human developer → process guidance
- **Example**: "Would you prefer a microservices or monolithic architecture?"

### 5. **Validation Questions** (`validationMethod`)
- **Source**: Testing strategy, acceptance criteria
- **Nature**: How to verify correctness/completeness
- **Interface**: Technical analysis → executable validation
- **Example**: "How do we test that the API handles 1000 concurrent users?"

## Interface Categorization

The system needs to identify and handle different types of interfaces that tickets may define:

### **External Interfaces**
- REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints
- File formats, protocols
- User interfaces, CLI commands
- Integration points with other systems
- **Answer Source**: API documentation, standards, existing integrations
- **Questions**: "What's the API contract?" "What data formats are expected?"

### **Internal Interfaces** 
- Data structures, type definitions
- Service boundaries, abstractions
- LLM query interfaces with retry logic (as mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- Database schemas, message formats
- **Answer Source**: Code analysis, architecture decisions, performance requirements
- **Questions**: "What's the internal data model?" "How do services communicate?"

## Recursive Decomposition Triggers

The decomposition process can be instigated in two primary ways:

### 1. **Human-Instigated Decomposition**
- User provides additional context
- Stakeholder answers open questions
- Requirements change or scope expands
- New constraints are discovered
- **Trigger Pattern**: External input → ticket refinement → new decomposition

### 2. **AI-Instigated Decomposition**
- AI identifies ambiguities in terms
- System discovers technical dependencies
- AI needs clarification on technical approaches
- Validation requirements become unclear
- **Trigger Pattern**: AI analysis → refinement request → human input → updated ticket

## Answer Source Routing Strategy

Different question types should be routed to appropriate answer sources:

### **Technical Questions** → Code analysis, architecture review, expert consultation
### **Business Questions** → Stakeholder interviews, requirements gathering
### **Validation Questions** → Test strategy design, acceptance criteria definition
### **Refinement Questions** → Technical decomposition, specification writing
### **Definition Questions** → Domain expert consultation, documentation review

## Implementation Considerations

### **Question Classification System**
- Automatic categorization of questions based on content and context
- Routing to appropriate answer collection mechanisms
- Priority assessment based on blocking potential

### **Answer Validation System**
- Verify answer completeness and accuracy
- Cross-reference with existing system knowledge
- Flag conflicts or inconsistencies

### **Refinement Loop Management**
- Track refinement cycles to prevent infinite loops
- Identify convergence patterns
- Optimize question ordering for efficiency

### **Context Preservation**
- Maintain question history and reasoning
- Preserve answer context for future decompositions
- Build knowledge base from successful patterns

## Future Extensions

### **Smart Answer Synthesis**
- Combine multiple partial answers into complete responses
- Identify conflicting information and resolve discrepancies
- Generate follow-up questions based on incomplete answers

### **Learning from Patterns**
- Track which question types lead to successful decompositions
- Identify common refinement patterns in specific domains
- Optimize question generation based on historical success

### **Integration Points**
- Connect with external documentation systems
- Interface with existing project management tools
- Integrate with code analysis and architecture tools
