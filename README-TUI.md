## üéØ Current Status

The TUI provides a **fully functional interface** for browsing and interacting with tickets, with rich navigation and contextual actions. The main limitation is that **action execution** currently shows loading messages rather than performing actual operations, as the underlying engine implementations are still needed.

### **What Works Now**
- Complete project and ticket navigation
- Rich ticket content display with highlighting
- Contextual action menus with live updates
- Search functionality across ticket content
- Full keyboard-driven workflow

### **What Needs Engine Support**
- Actual execution of ticket operations (create, edit, process)
- AI-powered refinement and decomposition
- Real-time ticket processing and updates
- Advanced dependency management
- Integration with external systems

## üö¶ Getting Started

```bash
# Run the TUI
cargo run --bin tui

# Navigation
‚Üë‚Üì Arrow keys: Navigate through fields
1-9: Execute numbered actions
Enter: Execute default action
/: Enter search mode
Esc: Go back/exit modes
q: Quit (from main menu)
```

The TUI is designed to be intuitive and discoverable - contextual help is always shown in the footer, and the interface guides you through available actions at each step.
