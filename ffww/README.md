‚úÖ App built successfully!
Usage: To run the application:
1. Save the code as todo_app.py
2. Run `python todo_app.py` from the command line
3. Use the following commands:
   - 'a <description>' to add a new task
   - 'l' to list all tasks
   - 'c <id>' to mark a task as complete
   - 'd <id>' to delete a task
   - 'x' to clear completed tasks
   - 's' to show task statistics
   - 'h' for help
   - 'q' to quit

To run the tests:
1. Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
2. Save the test code as test_todo_app.py in the same directory as todo_app.py
3. Run `pytest test_todo_app.py`

The application stores tasks in a JSON file (tasks.json by default) in the same directory as the script.

Files written: todo_app.py, test_todo_app.py
