# Control Flow Ticket Engine - Current Capabilities

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The Control Flow ticket engine is **functionally complete** for core ticket decomposition and management workflows. It successfully integrates with Claude AI for structured ticket processing and provides robust project management with persistent storage. The main gaps are in advanced UI interactions and specialized validation execution.

## ✅ **Fully Implemented & Working**

### **1. Core Ticket Processing Engine**
- **AI-Powered Decomposition**: Complete pipeline from natural language → structured tickets via Claude API
- **Character-Driven Prompts**: Uses `character.md` instructions for consistent ticket decomposition
- **JSON Response Parsing**: Robust extraction from Claude responses with fallback handling
- **Structured Data Models**: Rich ticket models with metadata, terms, questions, refinements

### **2. Project & Data Management**
- **Project Lifecycle**: Create, load, save, delete projects with JSON persistence
- **Workspace Organization**: Automatic project indexing and discovery
- **Ticket Graph System**: Dependency tracking with cycle detection and root/leaf identification
- **SHA256-Based IDs**: Consistent, hash-based ticket identification
- **Persistent Storage**: Projects and tickets survive application restarts

### **3. AI Client Infrastructure**
- **Low-Level Client Trait**: Generic `ask_raw()` interface supporting multiple AI providers
- **Claude API Integration**: Full authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry policies per error type with exponential backoff
- **Query Resolver**: Structured error types (AIError, ClaudeError, QueryResolverError)
- **Generic Deserialization**: Type-safe JSON parsing for any ticket structure

### **4. Refinement Workflow**
- **Automatic Refinement Detection**: Identifies terms needing clarification during decomposition
- **Refinement Ticket Creation**: Automatically generates focused tickets for unclear terms
- **Priority-Based Tracking**: Critical/High/Medium/Low priority system with visual indicators
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains relationships between parent and refinement tickets
- **Dependency Linking**: Proper graph connections for refinement relationships

### **5. User Interfaces**
- **Production CLI**: Complete menu-driven interface for all ticket operations
- **Advanced TUI**: Rich terminal UI with search, navigation, and contextual actions
- **Both Interfaces Support**:
  - Project creation and management
  - Ticket navigation and viewing
  - Dependency visualization
  - Interactive ticket decomposition
  - Refinement workflow execution

## ⚠️ **Partially Implemented (Framework Ready)**

### **1. TUI Action Execution**
- **Status**: Framework complete, actions show loading states but don't execute
- **What Works**: All contextual menus, action detection, user input handling
- **Missing**: Actual implementation of field-specific operations
- **Examples**: Edit ticket fields, create new tickets, change status/priority

### **2. Advanced Search Navigation**
- **Status**: Search finds matches correctly, but navigation to matches isn't implemented
- **What Works**: Real-time fuzzy search across all ticket content
- **Missing**: Jump to specific search results, highlight matches in context

### **3. Async Task Management in TUI**
- **Status**: Loading states exist but no background processing
- **What Works**: UI state management for long operations
- **Missing**: Background API calls, progress indicators, task cancellation

## ❌ **Not Implemented**

### **1. Validation Execution Engine**
- **Status**: Validation methods are stored in tickets but never executed
- **What Exists**: Data structure for validation methods and results
- **Missing**: 
  - Integration with testing frameworks
  - Execution environment for validation methods
  - Result collection and reporting
  - Pass/fail workflow integration

### **2. Question-Answer Iteration**
- **Status**: Questions are displayed but no mechanism to answer them
- **What Exists**: Open questions and engine questions in ticket structure
- **Missing**:
  - Input collection for question responses
  - Iteration workflow (question → answer → ticket update)
  - Integration with AI for answer validation
  - Question resolution tracking

### **3. Advanced Ticket Editing**
- **Status**: Tickets can be viewed but not modified after creation
- **Missing**:
  - In-place editing of ticket fields
  - Status and priority updates
  - Term definition modifications
  - Question addition/removal

### **4. Ticket Merging & Aggregation**
- **Status**: Refinement tickets are created but never merged back
- **Missing**:
  - Workflow to incorporate refinement results into parent tickets
  - Conflict resolution for competing refinements
  - Automatic term definition updates
  - Refinement completion tracking

## 🚀 **What You Can Do Right Now**

### **Core Workflow (Fully Functional)**
1. **Create a project** with name and description
2. **Input natural language** ticket descriptions
3. **Get AI-decomposed tickets** with structured metadata, terms, and refinements
4. **Navigate ticket hierarchies** with full dependency visualization
5. **Automatically generate refinement tickets** for unclear terms
6. **Search and browse** all ticket content with rich filtering
7. **Manage multiple projects** with persistent storage

### **Example Working Session**
```bash
# Start CLI
cargo run --bin cli

# Or start TUI for rich interface
cargo run --bin tui

# Create project "My App"
# Add ticket: "Build user authentication with OAuth"
# Get decomposed ticket with terms like "OAuth", "authentication"
# See automatic refinement requests for unclear terms
# Navigate dependency graph
# Search across all ticket content
```

## 🔧 **Architecture Strengths**

### **Production-Ready Components**
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with proper propagation
- **API Integration**: Real-world Claude API integration with auth and rate limiting
- **Data Persistence**: Robust JSON-based storage with proper indexing
- **UI Framework**: Both simple CLI and advanced TUI with full navigation

### **Extensible Design**
- **Generic AI Client**: Can support multiple AI providers beyond Claude
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between data, AI, and UI layers
- **Plugin-Ready**: Validation and question-answering can be added without major changes

### **Developer Experience**
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type system for ticket operations
- **Testing Ready**: Structured for unit and integration testing
- **Documentation**: Clear code organization and error messages

## 🎯 **Current Capabilities vs. Vision**

### **Core Vision: ✅ ACHIEVED**
> "AI-powered ticket decomposition with dependency management"

The system successfully takes natural language input and produces structured, interconnected tickets with automatic refinement detection.

### **Advanced Vision: 🚧 IN PROGRESS**
> "Complete ticket lifecycle with validation and iteration"

Framework exists for validation execution and question-answering, but implementation is needed.

### **Polish Vision: ⏳ PLANNED**
> "Production-ready interface with advanced features"

TUI provides excellent interface but needs action implementation for full production use.
