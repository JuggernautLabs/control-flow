## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Start with Phase 1, Milestone 1.1**: TUI ticket editing
2. **Focus on field editing**: Title, raw input, status, priority
3. **Add async task management**: Background operations with progress
4. **Test with real workflows**: Ensure changes persist correctly

### **Development Approach**
- **Incremental delivery**: Each milestone should be fully functional
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests for each new feature
- **User feedback early**: Get feedback on TUI changes quickly
- **Documentation as you go**: Update docs with each feature

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Preserve existing functionality**: Don't break working CLI/core engine
- **Graceful degradation**: Features should fail safely
- **Performance monitoring**: Watch for performance regressions
- **Backup strategies**: Ensure user data is never lost

This plan takes the Control Flow system from its current strong foundation to a production-ready, feature-complete ticket management platform with AI integration and advanced workflows.
